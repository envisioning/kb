# Why technology?

First, let’s kill the misconception that technology is limited to physical artefacts like Fuelbands, iPhones and Teslas. It’s not just the things that track us, beep and lose their signal.
Technology is everything we create. Technology is how we solve problems as a species.

Vaccines solved smallpox, Toothbrushes solved caries, Television solved boredom.

The endeavour of creatively solving societal problems. The accumulation of everything we've ever built. Designing and utilising technology seems to be at the core of what it means to be human. It seems to amplify our desires to control nature. With technology, we quite literally change our reality.

## Identifying technologies


* Look for possible  keywords connected to the technology/ technologies in the description
   Ex. SpaceX -> Reusable Rocket, Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship
* Use the Keywords to find main companies, startups or researchers working with the technology and look for native content (.edu, .org are the best) 
* Find commentary about the techs in journalistic articles (to grasp a sense of what the public outlook on the tech is)
