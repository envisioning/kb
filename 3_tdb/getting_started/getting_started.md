# Getting Started

## Why are we building this?

The project started as a way to streamline our research process. An unpleasing amount of work was done every time we started a new research. That is because we didn't have an appropriate tool to manage database that fit our workflow. We've been through it all: Trello, Basecamp, Spreadsheets, you name itâ€¦

### Current state

At the moment of this release (v0.8-Closed Beta), TDB primarily serves as a tool for Envisioning' projects. It was developed with our research workflow and needs in mind.

* Easy collection of technologies and assets
* Easy manipulation of data
* Easy export for Godzilla

## Where we're headed

Our long term goal is to create an open hub to discuss emerging technologies. A global platform that connects all parties involved with the subject. We want to move from an *internal tool* to an *open platform*. This is nowhere present in the platform as is, but is in our roadmap.
