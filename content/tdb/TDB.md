Welcome to the first closed beta run for TDB. We have selected a few of you to help testing and giving feedback on our new platform.

In this document we will talk about its current features and roadmap. At its current state, TDB’s purpose is to serve as the backend for Envisioning’s research projects. It will act as a central database for technologies, organizations, projects and attachments.

Our intent with TDB is to create a global and open service that will act as common ground for technology discussion.



The project started as a way to streamline our research process. An unpleasing amount of work was done every time we started a new research. That is because we didn't have an appropriate tool to manage database that fit our workflow. We've been through it all: Trello, Basecamp, Spreadsheets, you name it…

At the moment of this release (v0.8-Closed Beta), TDB primarily serves as a tool for Envisioning' projects. It was developed with our research workflow and needs in mind. Easy collection of technologies and assets, Easy manipulation of data & Easy export for Godzilla.

Our long term goal is to create an open hub to discuss emerging technologies. A global platform that connects all parties involved with the subject. We want to move from an *internal tool* to an *open platform*. This is nowhere present in the platform as is, but is in our roadmap.
