Everything is accelerating around us and we believe that technology has a crucial role in this process. Understanding it, questioning it & hacking it will result in better tools for us to build a more balanced future.

Envisioning is a new type of organization, designed to share intelligence with a global audience.

* We build tools to navigate complexity.
* We produce research with public and private institutions.
