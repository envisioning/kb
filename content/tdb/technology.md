## Creating and Editing


<img src="%image_url%/Screen Shot 2016-05-20 at 4.15.03 PM.png">


We follow some rules and style guide for creating and editing technologies.

**Isolating technologies from Products/Startups **

* Look for possible  keywords connected to the technology/ technologies in the description
  * SpaceX -> Reusable Rocket, Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship
*  Use the Keywords to find main companies, startups or researchers working with the technology and look for native content (.edu, .org are the best) 
* Find commentary about the techs in journalistic articles (to grasp a sense of what the public outlook on the tech is)

## Revision Status

Technologies follow a three stage status progression. The status is not related to the quality of the technology per se, but to the quality of the entry in TDB. Only technologies that are in the `Published` state are available for output to Godzilla, Futurekit, etc…

Technologies are first created as `Drafts`, which have no restrictions nor validation process. Regular `users` can create technologies, but only Editors & Admins can promote them to `Review` or `Published`.

### Descriptions

The same apply to descriptions. They have two status: `Draft` & `Published`. This allows to have a working description while another one is being developed. Only `Editors` & `Admins` can promote them to `Published`.
