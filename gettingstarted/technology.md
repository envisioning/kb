# Technology


## Isolating technologies from Products/Startups 

* Look for possible  keywords connected to the technology/ technologies in the description
  * SpaceX -> Reusable Rocket, Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship
*  Use the Keywords to find main companies, startups or researchers working with the technology and look for native content (.edu, .org are the best) 
* Find commentary about the techs in journalistic articles (to grasp a sense of what the public outlook on the tech is)
