# Why technology?

First, let’s kill the misconception that technology is limited to physical artefacts like Fuelbands, iPhones and Teslas. It’s not just the things that track us, beep and lose their signal.
Technology is everything we create. Technology is how we solve problems as a species.

Vaccines solved smallpox, Toothbrushes solved caries, Television solved boredom.

The endeavour of creatively solving societal problems. The accumulation of everything we've ever built. Designing and utilising technology seems to be at the core of what it means to be human. It seems to amplify our desires to control nature. With technology, we quite literally change our reality.
