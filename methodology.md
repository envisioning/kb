# Methodology

## Identifying technologies


* Look for possible  keywords connected to the technology/ technologies in the description
   Ex. SpaceX -> Reusable Rocket, Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship
* Use the Keywords to find main companies, startups or researchers working with the technology and look for native content (.edu, .org are the best) 
* Find commentary about the techs in journalistic articles (to grasp a sense of what the public outlook on the tech is)

## Readiness

Readiness is a model for estimating the state of emerging technologies. It measures how close an idea is to reality. Most technologies evolve along certain vectors over time, like acquiring usefulness and receiving investment. By determining common vectors of evolution, technologies can be compared. Readiness models an imaginary line between science fiction and science fact.

### What?

* To produce a quantifiable indicator of how close a technology is to manifesting
* To estimate technological evolution as well as social acceptance of emerging technologies

### Why?

* To help people compare readiness of different technologies
* To help people understand the rate of accelerating change

### Principles

* From the moment they are envisioned, all technologies are ready for others to build upon Readiness tends to increase over time
* After technologies mature as products, they are no longer emerging (next step in the life cycle)

### How?

* By developing an open technological readiness model
* By creating an open database of emerging technologies
* By asking falsifiable questions to estimate evolution for distinct criteria
* By subjectively attributing points to each technology

### Potential uses

* Common understanding of technology status
* Decision-making for technology funding
* Decision-making for technology transitions
* Risk management
