# Creating and Editing

![](Screen Shot 2016-05-20 at 4.15.03 PM.png)

We follow some rules and style guide for creating and editing technologies.

**Isolating technologies from Products/Startups **

* Look for possible  keywords connected to the technology/ technologies in the description
  * SpaceX -> Reusable Rocket, Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship
*  Use the Keywords to find main companies, startups or researchers working with the technology and look for native content (.edu, .org are the best) 
* Find commentary about the techs in journalistic articles (to grasp a sense of what the public outlook on the tech is)

## Alternative Title

These are not visible on the technology cards, but are used as search terms. This field is useful when we have a technology with different synonyms. We want to enforce using a correct nomenclature on the `Title` and additional names here.

**Example**

| Title | Alternative Titles|
|----|---|
| Delivery Drone | Payload Drone, Autonomous Delivery System |
