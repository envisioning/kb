Title: Why technology?
Description: Envisioning's Knowledge base

First, let’s kill the misconception that technology is limited to physical artefacts like Fuelbands, iPhones and Teslas. It’s not just the things that track us, beep and lose their signal.
Technology is everything we create. Technology is how we solve problems as a species.

**Vaccines solved smallpox, Toothbrushes solved caries, Television solved boredom.**

The endeavour of creatively solving societal problems. The accumulation of everything we've ever built. Designing and utilising technology seems to be at the core of what it means to be human. It seems to amplify our desires to control nature. With technology, we quite literally change our reality.

## Future studies

Since we are specifically studying them in order to create future scenarios, the aim of this research is to find and analyze **emerging technologies**, in other worlds, technologies that haven't yet showed their full potential of disruption.

Furthermore, it's important to highlight that **we're looking for emerging technology concepts, not their manifestations into products**. Thus, the search will probably start with the finding of a new company, product, service, patent or piece of research, but the final output has to be the definition of the underling technology that they represent.

Mistaken the underling technology with it's company/product of origin is common with technologies that are still in their early stages and haven't been developed by other competitors. However, more advanced technologies tend to develop into several others (e.g. laser > laser communication, laser print, laser gun) which might also cause confusion. 

Since a technology is by definition a thing that tries to solve a problem, so, as general rule, we will **treat different uses as different technologies** (e.g laser communication ≠ laser print ≠ laser gun) even though they are built by the same principle.
