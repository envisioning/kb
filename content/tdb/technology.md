## Creating and Editing


<img src="%image_url%/Screen Shot 2016-05-20 at 4.15.03 PM.png" align="left" height="400" width="400" >


We follow some rules and style guide for creating and editing technologies.

**Isolating technologies from Products/Startups **

* Look for possible  keywords connected to the technology/ technologies in the description
  * SpaceX -> Reusable Rocket, Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship
*  Use the Keywords to find main companies, startups or researchers working with the technology and look for native content (.edu, .org are the best) 
* Find commentary about the techs in journalistic articles (to grasp a sense of what the public outlook on the tech is)
