# Envisioning

Envisioning is a research institute that studies emerging technologies. 

Everything is accelerating around us and we believe that technology has a crucial role in this process. Understanding it, questioning it & hacking it will result in better tools for us to build a more balanced future.

Founded in 2011 by Michell Zappa, we've grown to a global network of collaborators. We help individuals, organizations and policymakers construct future scenarios.

## Why technology?

First, let’s kill the misconception that technology is limited to physical artefacts like Fuelbands, iPhones and Teslas. It’s not just the things that track us, beep and lose their signal.
Technology is everything we create. Technology is how we solve problems as a species.

Vaccines solved smallpox, Toothbrushes solved caries, Television solved boredom.

The endeavour of creatively solving societal problems. The accumulation of everything we've ever built. Designing and utilising technology seems to be at the core of what it means to be human. It seems to amplify our desires to control nature. With technology, we quite literally change our reality.
