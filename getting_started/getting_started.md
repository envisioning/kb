# Getting Started

## Why are we building this?

The project started as a way to streamline our research process. An unpleasing amount of work was done every time we started a new research. That is because we didn't have an appropriate tool to manage database that fit our workflow. We've been through it all: Trello, Basecamp, Spreadsheets, you name itâ€¦

## Current state

At the moment of this release (v0.8-Closed Beta), TDB primarily serves as a tool for Envisioning' projects. It is being developed with our research workflow and needs in mind.

* Easy collection / reorganization and manipulation of data
* Easy export for Godzilla
