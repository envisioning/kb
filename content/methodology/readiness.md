Readiness is a model for estimating the state of emerging technologies. It measures how close an idea is to reality. Most technologies evolve along certain vectors over time, like acquiring usefulness and receiving investment. By determining common vectors of evolution, technologies can be compared. Readiness models an imaginary line between science fiction and science fact.

**What?**

* To produce a quantifiable indicator of how close a technology is to manifesting
* To estimate technological evolution as well as social acceptance of emerging technologies

**Why?**

* To help people compare readiness of different technologies
* To help people understand the rate of accelerating change

**Principles**

* From the moment they are envisioned, all technologies are ready for others to build upon Readiness tends to increase over time
* After technologies mature as products, they are no longer emerging (next step in the life cycle)

**How?**

* By developing an open technological readiness model
* By creating an open database of emerging technologies
* By asking falsifiable questions to estimate evolution for distinct criteria
* By subjectively attributing points to each technology

**Potential uses**

* Common understanding of technology status
* Decision-making for technology funding
* Decision-making for technology transitions
* Risk management

# How it works?

Ten vectors are measured. Technologies are  scored on growth along each vector. Point Scores are attributed on a human-readable scale

Ten vectors are measured.
Technologies are  scored on growth along each vector.
Point Scores are attributed on a human-readable scale.

| Can it be done? | Is it important? |
| -- | -- |
| **Feasibility:** *Is the technology scientifically viable?* | **Explainability:** *Do people understand it?* |
| **Demonstrability:** *Has it been demonstrated to work?* | **Usefulness:** *Do people use it?* |
| **Breakthrough**: *Is it measurably better than preceding technologies?* | **Necessity:** *Do people need it?* |
| **Investment**: *How far along the investment cycle is it?* | **Competition:** *Do people compete to develop it?* |
| **Cost**: *How are development costs behaving?* | **Challenge:** *Has it proven to address humanity's grand challenges?* |

## Mathematical Model

Point Scores are combined into a Final Score. Final Score is calculated as the harmonic mean of Point Scores. Harmonic mean is the preferable method for averaging ranges. Final Score indicates overall readiness in thresholds.
