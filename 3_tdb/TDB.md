# Introduction

Welcome to the first closed beta run for TDB. We have selected a few of you to help testing and giving feedback on our new platform.

In this document we will talk about its current features and roadmap. At its current state, TDB’s purpose is to serve as the backend for Envisioning’s research projects. It will act as a central database for technologies, organizations, projects and attachments.

Our intent with TDB is to create a global and open service that will act as common ground for technology discussion.
